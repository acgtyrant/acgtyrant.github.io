Hi, I am acgtyrant, but you can call me Isaac Ge too.

This is my poor personal homepage. I can not make it beautiful until I'm familiar with the HTML5 & CSS. When the time is right, I will put my about here. However, you can visit my <a href="about.me/acgtyrant/">about.me</a> now.

If you want to contact me, just <a href="mailto:acgtyrant@gmail.com">email me</a>, or <a href="twitter.com/acgtyrant"mention me</a> at the twitter directly.

You can find my blog <a href="blog.acgtyrant.com">here</a>. Actually I am also maintaining an <a href="arch.acgtyrant.com">blog</a> for Arch Linux Community for China.

That's all. Enjoy!
